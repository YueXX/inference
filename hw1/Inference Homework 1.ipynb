Intuitively, this is because the effect of Forecast on Cold is diluted by the all the variables between them. Even if the weatherman forecasts 100% chance of rain, in order for that to result in me being cold, his prediction for rain must be accurate, I probably have to have forgetten my umbrella, and I probably had have gotten drenched. Even then, me being drenched is not a perfect predictor of me being cold. For the probability of Cold to increase significantly, the conditional probability distributions on the variables between it and Forecast must change as well."
