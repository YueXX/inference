    "Even though the prior probability for the WillRain forecast went from 30% to 100%, the probability of the Yes value for Cold only increased from 53.49% to 58.07%. Intuitively, this is because the effect of Forecast on Cold is diluted by the all the variables between them. Even if the weatherman forecasts 100% chance of rain, in order for that to result in me being cold, his prediction for rain must be accurate, I probably have to have forgetten my umbrella, and I probably had have gotten drenched. Even then, me being drenched is not a perfect predictor of me being cold. For the probability of Cold to increase significantly, the conditional probability distributions on the variables between it and Forecast must change as well."

    "Observing the sprinkler's state alone has no effect on the marginal probability of it being cold. This is because Cold and Rain are both parents of WetGrass. The Bayes Ball algorithm states that information from one parent cannot flow through its child to another parent unless the child has also been observed. That is why, when WetGrass was set to \"Yes\", the likelihood of Cold increased. Now that we know the sprinkler was off, and that the grass is dry, it makes it all but certain that it rained, which increases the liklihood of being cold."

This is because, in this situation, I always have my umbrella when it rains, making it less likely that I will get drenched, and thus less likely making it less likely that I get cold from being drenched. To test this, we can observe \"Rain = Yes\", and see that the marginal likelihood for Umbrella increases to 100%."
